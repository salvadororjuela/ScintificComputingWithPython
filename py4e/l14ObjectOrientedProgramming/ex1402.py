"""To get credit for this assignment, perform the instructions below and upload your 
SQLite3 database here:
XXXXXXXXXXXXX Ning√∫n archivo seleccionado
(Must have a .sqlite suffix)
Hint: The top organizational count is 536.
You do not need to export or convert the database - simply upload the .sqlite file 
that your program creates. See the example code for the use of the connect() statement.

Counting Organizations
This application will read the mailbox data (mbox.txt) and count the number of email 
messages per organization (i.e. domain name of the email address) using a database with 
the following schema to maintain the counts.

CREATE TABLE Counts (org TEXT, count INTEGER)
When you have run the program on mbox.txt upload the resulting database file above for 
grading.
If you run the program multiple times in testing or with dfferent files, make sure to 
empty out the data before each run.

You can use this code as a starting point for your application: 
http://www.py4e.com/code3/emaildb.py.

The data file for this application is the same as in previous assignments: 
http://www.py4e.com/code3/mbox.txt.

Because the sample code is using an UPDATE statement and committing the results to the 
database as each record is read in the loop, it might take as long as a few minutes to 
process all the data. The commit insists on completely writing all the data to disk 
every time it is called.

The program can be speeded up greatly by moving the commit operation outside of the loop. 
In any database program, there is a balance between the number of operations you execute 
between commits and the importance of not losing the results of operations that have not 
yet been committed."""
